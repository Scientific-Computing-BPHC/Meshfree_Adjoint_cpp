# Meshfree_Adjoint_cpp

Scientific Computing @ BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus.

Development of the adjoint meshfree solver for inviscid compressible fluid flows in C++. The meshfree solver is based on the Least Squares
Kinetic Upwind Method (q-LSKUM), developed by Deshpande et. al. 

This work is done as part of my M.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics Thesis, under the guidance of Dr. N. Anil, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics, BITS Pilani - Hyderabad, and Professor S.M. Deshpande, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre For Advanced Scientific Research.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Serial Adjoint Code with CoDiPack
- [ ] Optimize and Benchmark Serial Primal once again
- [ ] CUDAfy CoDiPack based Adjoint Solver

## Support:

Please contact the author for running the code, and Dr. N. Anil for access to the input grids.
